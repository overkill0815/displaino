playground for a arduino based wifi display


   this software is based on the demo from the
   project:
   https://github.com/squix78/esp8266-oled-ssd1306
   (so a zip-download from that repo is sufficient
   as added library)

   we are using a 128x64 oled via i2c on a wemos d1 mini
   physical pin-outs match: d3/d4 for SDA/SLC
